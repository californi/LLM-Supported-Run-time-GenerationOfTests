The number of users and request rate (0.0 req/s) is low, but the system's health is still in a critical state.

The number of users and request rate (0.0 req/s) is low, but the system's health is still in a critical state. This suggests that the current load pattern, which is a burst pattern, is causing the system to become overloaded. Therefore, a load test would be the most appropriate test type to conduct in order to identify the system's capacity and scalability limits.\n\nREQUIREMENT: Generate tests ONLY for \"load\" type.\n\nTEST GUIDELINES:\n- response_time: latency, performance, resource efficiency, network tests, pod metrics, service endpoints, resource monitoring, CPU/memory usage, response time validation, endpoint accessibility\n- reachability: connectivity, availability, pod status, health checks, service discovery, network policies, pod readiness, service endpoints, DNS resolution, port accessibility\n- load: capacity, scalability, stress, resource limits, throughput, horizontal pod autoscaling, resource utilization, performance degradation, bottleneck identification\n\nGenerate comprehensive test suites based on system state.
